# Tasks: Self-Organizing Notebook PWA

**Input**: Design documents from implementation plan, data model, and contracts  
**Prerequisites**: âœ… plan.md, âœ… research.md, âœ… data-model.md, âœ… contracts/

## Project Overview
Progressive Web Application for capturing and organizing notes with AI-powered tagging, multiple view modes, local-first storage, and spaced repetition review. Built with vanilla JavaScript, Dexie.js, and Workbox for maximum simplicity and learning.

**Technology Stack**: Vanilla JS + HTML5 + CSS3, Dexie.js, Workbox, OpenAI API  
**Target**: Personal use on Tailscale network, mobile-first PWA  
**Performance**: <50ms save, <200ms render, <120ms search

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions
- Follow TDD: Tests before implementation
- Constitution compliance: Simplicity, documentation, performance

## Dependencies
**Critical Path Dependencies:**
- Setup (T001-T010) before all other phases
- Tests (T011-T025) before implementation (T026-T060)
- Utilities (T026-T028) before database (T029-T036)
- Database (T029-T036) before state management (T037-T038)  
- State management (T037-T038) before UI (T039-T049)
- Core UI (T039-T049) before integration (T050-T060)
- Implementation complete before polish (T061-T072)

**File-Level Dependencies:**
- T029 (db.js setup) blocks T030-T033 (database operations)
- T037 (state.js) blocks T045-T049 (view controllers) 
- T039 (index.html) blocks T040-T041 (PWA features)
- T034-T036 (AI service) can run parallel with database tasks
